Cat2 --> How to compile cat-game to exe and mac?...

Basic game, set up for compile using releasy by spooner.

I have set up a Gemfile, as explained in releasy readme.

I have set up a Rakefile, as explained in releasy readme.

I have adjusted the Gemfile to use rake ~>0.9.2.2 for compatibility with releasy.

I have included the downloaded wrappers in the approriate location.

When I type:
$ rake

I get:
rake aborted!
wrong number of arguments (3 for 1)

I think I am doing something wrong...
